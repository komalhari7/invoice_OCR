# Invoice OCR using Object Detection

A python project to extract textual information from invoices using PaddleOCR for OCR & Yolov11s for the extraction of region of interest (bounding boxes of fields).  

Yolov11s was trained on dataset of invoices labelled on 18 classesâ€” Discount_Percentage, Due_Date, Email_Client, Name_Client, Products, Remise, Subtotal, Tax, Tax_Precentage, Tel_Client, billing address, invoice date, invoice number, shipping address, supplier-address, supplier-name, supplier-phone, total.





## Features

- Performs Object Detection followed by Text Extraction.
- Outputs the extracted text in a structual format (JSON).
- The extracted text is mapped to its corresponding class defined in the dataset.
- This project was run on Test files (dataset/test/images), and the output is stored in JSON_output folder.
